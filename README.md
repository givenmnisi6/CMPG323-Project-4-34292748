# Testing & Robotic process automation (RPA)

## More about the Project
- Testing is a crucial part of any solution and can be done from many different perspectives. Examples include internal development team testing, business user acceptance testing (UAT), etc.
- Robotic process automation (RPA) it is the use of AI & machine learning to replicate human activities in a manner similar to how a person would carry out a process. Typically, this refers to automation on the "front end" or UI (User Interface). RPA is frequently used to automate laborious, repetitive processes so that workers have more time to focus on creative work. 
- RPAs are software applications that can configure tasks and automate them. Some popular RPA tools are UiPath, Automation Anywhere, blueprism, PEGA etc.


## Pre-requisites
- UiPath
- Microsoft Edge
- Microsoft Excel

## Manual for the Project
- The user can open the project here and download it & run it via UiPath.
- The user needs to first create go to their UiPath Orchestrator, then go to Assets & add an Asset. 
- It should be called LoginCredentials with the following Credentials, after you Save.

| Credentials   | User            | 
| :------------ |:---------------:|
| Email         | john@gmail.com  | 
| Password      | Abc123!         | 

- This is needed so that credentials are not stored anywhere where they are vulnerable.

## Phase 1 - GitHub Administration
- While I'm undergoing training, I've created and configured my GitHub repository.

## Phase 2 - Project Setup 
- I have Cloned my GitHub repository.
- Installed UiPath Studio.
- Created the "Connected Office Web Application - User Acceptance Testing" UiPath process.

## Phase 3 - User Acceptance Testing
- The data from Excel has been read into a table in UiPath and it is readable and iterated over in UiPath.

## Phase 4 - Project Close-out
- Published the UiPath solution to the UiPath Orchestrator.
